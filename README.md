A Godot 4 spinning-top roguelite prototype, currently in early prototype development.

Core direction:

- fixed isometric gameplay camera
- modular Blade / Ratchet / Bit top construction
- physics-driven spinning-top combat
- roguelite run escalation
- Aseprite-heavy pixel-art presentation

Open `project.godot` with Godot 4.7.2, let assets import, and press **F5**.
WASD/arrows steer, Space bursts, Shift brakes, and Esc pauses.
Gamepad: left stick steers, bottom face button bursts/confirms, either shoulder
or trigger brakes, and Menu/Start pauses. D-pad or stick navigates every menu;
the east face button goes back. Keyboard, mouse and gamepad coexist through
Godot input actions. Controller support is a core Task 002A requirement.

Editable pixel-art sources are in `assets/source-art/`. Existing prototype details
and validation notes are retained in `README.txt` and `QA.txt`.

Task 002A adds an eight-encounter Run alongside Quick Duel. Choose your assembly
before starting; it stays locked until the Run ends. Wins after slots 1, 2, 3, 4,
6 and 7 offer three unowned powers. Collect six, finish eight duels, or restart
from slot 1 after defeat. Escape pauses both combat and the stored reward choice.

All Run encounters currently use ordinary duel fixtures. The twelve power cards
are collectible **inactive scaffolding**; their combat effects, special rivals,
swarm, arena events and boss are deferred. The old three-battle gauntlet is replaced
by this Run. See [TASK-002A.md](TASK-002A.md) for architecture, test results, replay
changes and the arena source-art follow-up.

Run automated suites with Godot 4.7.2:

```text
Godot --headless --path . --editor --import
Godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/test_flow.gd
Godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/test_run_context.gd
Godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/test_combat_architecture.gd
Godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/test_menus.gd
Godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/test_controller.gd
```

Run `tests/test_prototype.gd` only in a disposable copy: the preserved baseline
harness overwrites `QA.txt` and `tests/balance-results.json`. Those tracked files
remain historical Task 001 evidence. For rendered integration captures, launch
with `-- --smoke-test --capture-dir=<absolute-directory>`; victories in that smoke
loop are explicitly injected flow fixtures, not evidence of played Run balance.
